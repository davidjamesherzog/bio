###   **CardConnect** (King of Prussia, PA)
####  **Software Architect, 2013-2015**
    
- Architected and built Merchant Portal application for merchants using Spring and AngularJS.  The original application was written using Oracle APEX and PL/SQL.  The application had to be re-architected from the ground floor up to make it an enterprise strength application so that it could handle standard web traffic along with batch processing for recurring billing and emailing of daily reports.  Maven, Grunt and Bower were used to manage java and javascript dependencies, run java and javascript tests, compiling of SASS files to CSS and minifying and obfuscating javascript and CSS.
- Architected and built SFTP application for merchants to tokenize credit cards and process credit card transactions using Spring and Apache Camel to route the data properly.
- Architected and built hosted payment page application for merchants to offload credit card processing responsibilities.
- Architected and built RESTful application for agents to electronically on board merchants using Spring, JPA and Maven.
- Architected and built auditing application that captures requests and responses for all failed services.  The audit application is comprised of a set of asynchronous RESTful services that can be called by any application that experiences a problem and not impact the performance of the application. This gives us the ability to be proactive with application issues instead of being reactive.
- Investigate and migrate applications to be clustered using JBoss domains for EAP 6.0 from community version 7.1.1
- Introduce the company to test driven development and teach and mentor peers on how to write effective tests using a mix of unit and integration tests with in-memory HSQLDB databases.
- Implemented Maven as a build, test and software management tool along with an Artifactory server
- Investigate different online video training sites and recommend which one should be used by developers for training
- Use TestNG to write automated unit tests
- In charge of distributing Eclipse installation and updates to fellow programmers
- Investigate and correct software defects.
- Test all changes for conformance.
- Majority of my responsibilities were architecting, prototyping, developing, designing and testing.
